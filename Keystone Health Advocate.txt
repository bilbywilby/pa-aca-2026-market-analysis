As your Project Management Consultant, I have developed the following Risk Management Plan (RMP) tailored to the Keystone Health Advocate project.
Given the integration of the Layered Memory Protocol (LMP) and the PmWiki-based Forensic Tool, the primary risk vectors involve technical performance (latency/drift), data integrity (medical-legal implications), and system scalability.
🛡️ Risk Management Plan: Keystone Health Advocate
1. Risk Management Strategy
The project will utilize a Proactive Mitigation Strategy. We will focus on technical safeguards (automated checks) and governance controls to address risks before they impact the critical path or the semantic integrity of the medical rights wiki.
2. Risk Assessment Matrix
Risks are categorized by Probability (P) and Impact (I) on a scale of 1-5.
| Risk ID | Category | Risk Description | P | I | Score | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TEC-01 | Technical | Semantic Drift: RAG retrieval falls below S_c < 0.85. | 3 | 5 | 15 | Prometheus semantic_similarity_score alert. |
| TEC-02 | Technical | Commit Latency: Interaction loop exceeds 500\text{ms}. | 4 | 3 | 12 | Average retrieval_latency_ms > 450\text{ms}. |
| DAT-01 | Privacy | PII Leakage: Sensitive health data stored unhashed. | 2 | 5 | 10 | Security audit failure or database scan hit. |
| OPS-01 | Operations | State Corruption: Version collision (v_{in} \leq v_t). | 2 | 4 | 8 | Failed SaveCheckpoint transaction log. |
| GOV-01 | Governance | Content Stale: Wiki data out of sync with PA law. | 3 | 4 | 12 | User-reported inaccuracies or > 6mo since last audit. |
3. Mitigation & Contingency Profiles
High Priority: TEC-01 (Semantic Drift)
 * Mitigation: Implement the KnowledgePruner to remove decayed or redundant vectors weekly. Utilize inner-product search on L2-normalized vectors to maintain mathematical equivalence to cosine similarity.
 * Contingency: Roll back the Vector Store to the last "Golden Snapshot" (M3) and re-index the episodic event store.
High Priority: TEC-02 (Performance Bottleneck)
 * Mitigation: Horizontal replication of API nodes. Ensure all production instances are CPU-optimized to handle FAISS high-concurrency search requirements.
 * Contingency: Implement "Degraded Mode"—temporarily bypass the Semantic Layer and rely on the Ephemeral Redis layer for recent context only.
Critical Priority: DAT-01 (PII Leakage)
 * Mitigation: Strict enforcement of the hashing protocol at the application layer before entering the Episodic Layer. Use UUID primary keys for session isolation at the DB level.
 * Contingency: Immediate session termination and automated "purge" routine to scrub identified records from PostgreSQL and FAISS indices.
4. Monitoring & Observability (QoS)
Risk monitoring is integrated directly into the technical stack using the following metrics:
 * checkpoint_commits_total: Success rate of persistence; low rates indicate state corruption risks (OPS-01).
 * retrieval_latency_ms: Histogram of RAG performance to monitor latency risks (TEC-02).
 * semantic_similarity_score: Real-time gauge for context relevance to prevent drift (TEC-01).
5. Roles & Responsibilities
 * Risk Owner (Project Lead): Accountable for the overall risk register and budget for mitigations.
 * Technical Auditor (Lead Architect): Responsible for the automated validation of the "Logic Path & Avoidance List" to prevent architectural regression.
 * Data Steward: Oversees the PII hashing compliance and Wiki content accuracy.
🔍 Consultant Recommendations
To strengthen this plan, I recommend:
 * Automated Stress Testing: Run pytest -m integration under simulated high-load to find the breaking point of the 500\text{ms} latency constraint.
 * Legal Content Buffer: Assign a dedicated legal researcher to validate the wikilib.d/ content against current Pennsylvania statutes before the M4 launch.
Would you like me to proceed with the "Technical Interface Contracts" to define exactly how the developers should implement these safety guards, or should we move to the "Stakeholder Engagement Strategy"?
