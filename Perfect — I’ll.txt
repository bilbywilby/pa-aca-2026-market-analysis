Pennsylvania ACA 2026 Rate Increases by Rating Area

A consumer-friendly breakdown of what’s coming next year

Pennsylvania’s Department of Insurance has approved premium increases for 2026 ACA marketplace plans. These increases vary sharply by rating area and by carrier, meaning where you live will matter just as much as who you buy insurance from.

Below is a clear, organized view of the increases we currently have — followed by what’s missing.

🗺️ How Pennsylvania Is Divided

Pennsylvania has 9 ACA rating areas.
Each area groups counties with similar healthcare cost structures.

We currently have data for Areas 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8.

> Missing from this dataset:
Areas 2, 5, 7, and 9



Those areas cover large parts of central, south-central, and western PA, so this is not a small omission.

🧭 Big Picture Trends

1️⃣ Philadelphia is the epicenter of price inflation

Ambetter nearly +40%

IBX over +22% Urban healthcare costs + hospital consolidation are driving this.

In both western PA regions:

Area 1: UPMC +20.2% vs Highmark +14.5%

Area 4: UPMC +20.2% vs Highmark +17.7%


3️⃣ Geisinger is PA’s pricing anchor

Geisinger’s 11.6% is the lowest increase anywhere in this dataset.

4️⃣ Capital Advantage is becoming high-risk for consumers

At 24.6%, it’s now priced closer to Oscar and IBX than Highmark.
